# Give-Me-A-Name

In 2014, [fivethirtyeight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com/) published an article entitled "How to Tell Someone's Age When All You Know is Her Name". Using data from the Social Security Administration (SSA) on first names of U.S. babies, the authors were able to calculate the median age for each name. 

"Give-Me-A-Name" is a class project to practice writing several functions using the SSA data in R and to make documentations for these functions using [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).
